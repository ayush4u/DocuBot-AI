# Advanced RAG System Documentation

## ðŸš€ Industry-Standard Multi-Document RAG Implementation

The Advanced RAG Service implements best practices from leading RAG-based projects and supports sophisticated multi-document analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Strategy Retrieval**
- **Vector Similarity Search**: ChromaDB-powered semantic search
- **Keyword-Based Search**: Fallback for when vector search fails
- **Entity-Based Search**: Targeted extraction (skills, experience, education)
- **Document-Specific Search**: Queries targeting specific documents

### 2. **Advanced Query Analysis**
- **Query Type Detection**: Comparison, summary, extraction, search, multi-document
- **Intent Recognition**: Question, request, explanation classification
- **Target Document Identification**: Automatically identifies which documents are relevant
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each classification includes confidence metrics

### 3. **Smart Document Processing**
- **Semantic Chunking**: Preserves sentence boundaries and context
- **Enhanced Metadata Extraction**: Document type, entity, topic identification
- **Multi-Level Chunking**: Both sentence and paragraph level processing
- **Document Caching**: In-memory caching for faster subsequent queries

### 4. **Re-ranking and Scoring**
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines retrieval strategy, relevance, and chunk quality
- **Strategy-Based Boosting**: Different weights for vector vs keyword results
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Longer, informative chunks get higher scores
- **Query-Type Optimization**: Boosts results based on query type

### 5. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**
- **Multi-Document Context**: Organizes information by source document
- **Query-Specific Instructions**: Tailored prompts for different query types
- **Conversation History Integration**: Maintains context across conversations
- **Citation Support**: Automatically includes source attribution

## ðŸ“Š Query Types Supported

### General Queries
```
"What information do you have?"
"Tell me about the documents"
```

### Document-Specific Queries
```
"What does the resume.pdf say about skills?"
"Compare information between document1 and document2"
```

### Extraction Queries
```
"What are the skills mentioned?"
"List all the experience"
"What education qualifications are there?"
```

### Comparison Queries
```
"Compare the skills between candidates"
"What are the differences between these documents?"
```

### Summary Queries
```
"Summarize all documents"
"Give me an overview of the main points"
```

### Multi-Document Queries
```
"What information is available across all documents?"
"Find common themes in all uploaded files"
```

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Retrieval Strategies
1. **Vector Search** (60% of results): Semantic similarity using ChromaDB
2. **Keyword Search** (40% of results): Token-based matching with TF-IDF scoring
3. **Entity Search** (30% of results): Pattern-based extraction for specific entities
4. **Document-Specific** (Variable): Targeted search within mentioned documents

### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
finalScore = baseScore * strategyBoost * queryTypeBoost * qualityBoost
```

- **Strategy Boost**: Vector (1.0), Keyword (0.8), Entity (0.9), Doc-Specific (1.1)
- **Query Type Boost**: Extraction + matching entity type (1.3x)
- **Quality Boost**: Long chunks (1.1x), Short chunks (0.7x)

### Caching System
- **Document Cache**: Processed documents with chunks, entities, topics
- **Query Cache**: Recent query results (5-minute TTL)
- **Context Cache**: Conversation history and smart context building

## ðŸ”„ Processing Flow

```
1. Query Analysis
   â”œâ”€â”€ Determine query type (comparison, extraction, etc.)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Identify target documents
   â”œâ”€â”€ Extract keywords and entities
   â””â”€â”€ Calculate confidence scores

2. Multi-Strategy Retrieval
   â”œâ”€â”€ Vector similarity search
   â”œâ”€â”€ Keyword-based search
   â”œâ”€â”€ Entity-specific search
   â””â”€â”€ Document-specific search

3. Result Re-ranking
   â”œâ”€â”€ Apply strategy-based weights
   â”œâ”€â”€ Boost based on query type
   â”œâ”€â”€ Score content quality
   â””â”€â”€ Remove duplicates

4. Response Generation
   â”œâ”€â”€ Build context-aware prompt
   â”œâ”€â”€ Include multi-document organization
   â”œâ”€â”€ Add query-specific instructions
   â””â”€â”€ Generate LLM response

5. Post-processing
   â”œâ”€â”€ Add source citations
   â”œâ”€â”€ Cache results
   â”œâ”€â”€ Save conversation context
   â””â”€â”€ Return enhanced response
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimizations

### Chunking Strategy
- **Semantic Chunking**: 800 chars with 200 char overlap
- **Sentence Preservation**: Maintains natural language boundaries
- **Context Windows**: Optimal size for embedding models

### Caching Layers
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory document processing cache
- **L2 Cache**: Query result cache (5 min TTL)
- **L3 Cache**: Conversation context cache

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Vector search â†’ Keyword search â†’ Entity search â†’ Generic response
- ChromaDB unavailable â†’ In-memory keyword search
- LLM failure â†’ Intelligent fallback responses

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

### Resume Analysis
- Extract skills, experience, education from multiple resumes
- Compare candidates across different criteria
- Generate comprehensive summaries

### Document Comparison
- Side-by-side analysis of multiple documents
- Identify similarities and differences
- Highlight unique information per document

### Research Papers
- Multi-document literature review
- Extract methodologies, findings, conclusions
- Cross-reference citations and concepts

### Financial Reports
- Analyze multiple quarterly reports
- Extract key metrics and trends
- Compare performance across time periods

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options


```javascript
const options = {
  maxResults: 10,           // Max chunks to retrieve
  includeHistory: true,     // Use conversation history
  temperature: 0.7,         // LLM creativity level
  maxTokens: 1024,         // Response length limit
  useCache: true,          // Enable caching
  crossDocumentSearch: true, // Search across all docs
  rerankResults: true      // Apply advanced re-ranking
};
```



## ðŸ“Š Response Metadata

Each response includes comprehensive metadata:

```javascript
{
  "response": "Generated answer...",
  "metadata": {
    "documentsAnalyzed": 5,
    "chunksRetrieved": 8,
    "queryType": "extraction",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "retrievalStrategy": "multi-strategy",
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
  }
}
```
